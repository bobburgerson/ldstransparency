# The LDS financial transparency project
A project to collect, compile and estimate financial information about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the church).  The church is an unusually financially opaque organization that requires its members to pay 10% tithe of their income.  In addition, church financial management is highly centralized and this could lead to a lack of financial accountability outside of a small group of church leadership.  Therefore

# Disclaimer
This not an audit or review of the church's financial information, and should not be relied upon as such.  It is only to provide information to the public that is objective and not misleading.

# Objectives
- Estimate the church's consolidated global net assets.
- Estimate the church's consolidated revenues by source (tithing, investment income etc.).
- Estimate the church's consolidated operating and capital expenditures.
- Estimate regional financial data.
- Collect information about financial reporting, legislative and regulatory requirements by region.
- Identify and collect information about non-arms length (related or closely associated) parties, and significant transactions with those parties.
- Identify structures or schemes that obsfucate the disclosure of financial information.

## Discussions
The purpose of this project is to be objective and simply state facts.  Please follow these rules to keep things civil and on task or face removal from the project:

- Do not to debate theological or spiritual or personal matters.  
- 
## Information sources
The quality of the information is critcal to this project.  Garbage in is garbage out.  The following will be considered when merging the information into this project:

- Publicly available
  - Any member of the public should be able to acquire this information.
  - This does not mean that it is "easy" to acquire.  Sometimes acquiring information requires sigificant work, such as record searches.
- Authoritative
  - Data from sources where the church is legally obligated to report accurately to are of higher quality (eg. government bodies, regulatory associations etc.)
- Verifiable   
  - The source of the information should be documented such that somebody independent of this project could easily find it.
  - Leaked internal documents typically do not fit this criteria as they cannot be verified against an authoritative source reliably.
- Corroborative
  - Where authority and verfiability are difficult, the information should corroborate with information that is.
- Legally acquired.
  - Do not contravene any laws in your jurisdiction to acquire information.

## Examples of sources
- Charity financial information required by tax authorities.  For example, Revenue Canada publishes the data from charity financial returns.
- Publicly available property registry data.
- Publicly available financial statements of organizations or companies that have significant business with the church or related entities.
- News reports from credible journalists.
- 

## A note about privacy
Please do not post confidential information.  Use only publicly available and verifiable sources. Public information about public figures and leaders is OK, however private and confidential information about them is NOT OK.

# Disclosure / Potential Bias
The creator of this project's intent is to provide an objective view on the church's financial position, however it should be stated that the creator is a former member of the church which may introduce some bias.  Please encourage contributors from diverse viewpoints to contribute to this project to help reduce bias.
